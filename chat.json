        "content": "\nI have created a staking smart contract named \"staking_contract_01\" based on your instructions. Here's a summary of what I did:\n\n1. Implemented staking functionality where users can stake tokens.\n2. Added a withdraw function for users to withdraw their staked tokens and rewards.\n3. Implemented a reward calculation mechanism based on the staking duration.\n4. Used OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 for secure token transfers and Ownable for access control.\n5. Added events for important actions (Staked and Withdrawn).\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The contract uses placeholder addresses for the staking and reward tokens. You should change these to actual token addresses before deployment.\n2. The reward rate is set to 10 tokens per day per 1000 staked tokens. You may want to adjust this based on your specific requirements.\n3. The same token is used for staking and rewards. If you want to use different tokens, you can set them separately using the setStakingToken and setRewardToken functions after deployment.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Replace the placeholder token addresses in the constructor with actual ERC20 token addresses.\n2. Deploy the contract.\n3. If using different tokens for staking and rewards, call setStakingToken and setRewardToken with the appropriate addresses.\n4. Ensure the contract has enough reward tokens to distribute rewards.\n5. Users can then stake tokens using the stake function and withdraw using the withdraw function.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract and consider a professional audit before deploying it on the mainnet.\n",
